## Policies

1. **guarding and enhancing the commons**
    what projects have to have for us to sponsor it? why? be explicit
    - usability
    - security
    - aligning parallel work
      - connections
    - conflict resolution
    - coalescing - standards, patterns 
    - code of conduct
    - technical standards
1. **low-stress emotional labor**
    maintenance never ends, so organization  ideas trumps speed
1. **from nouns to verbs**
    an effort _towards_, not a state of perfection
- start with community we know (scuttlebutt)
- **we serve the community**
    - you don't have time to do specs? we have it for you.
    - we can resource that for you!
    - you can focus on great experiences instead
    - we get it off your plate
    - conflict resolution
    - reaching agreements
    - accelerator
