# v0.2.0 - Information Consolidation

Epic for consolidating scattered information sources into single source of truth.

## Research: Commons.garden vs Management Commons Literature

**Date:** 2026-01-29
**Research Query:** Comparison against management commons books - what's similar, better, worse?

### What the Literature Already Does (and you're replicating):

**1. Knowledge as Commons (done well)**

"Understanding Knowledge as a Commons" already treats collaborative knowledge exactly like commons.garden: a shared resource that needs collective creation, dissemination, and preservation. Peter Levine argues that **the process of creating public knowledge is itself a good** because it strengthens communities and develops civic capacities.

**Similarity with commons.garden:** You also treat SSB knowledge/specs as a shared resource requiring coordination.

---

**2. Self-Governance Requires Structures (you need this)**

The literature is explicit: self-governance of emerging commons requires:
- Definition of **boundaries** (clear frontiers)
- **Design and enforcement of rules**
- Extension of **reciprocity**
- Building **trust and social capital**
- Delineation of **communication channels**

**Difference:** Commons.garden doesn't yet have clear formal governance. The literature shows this is critical - without democratically negotiated rules by stakeholders, you risk "tragedy of the commons."

---

**3. Community-Based Participatory Groups (you do this partially)**

Research on natural resource commons shows that **community-based participatory groups** can solve decision problems. They must be:
- Inclusive
- Have community-wide reputation for honesty
- Help disparate groups find shared interests

**Commons.garden does:** Show-and-tell, Signal groups, FigJam discussions
**Literature says is missing:** Formal conflict resolution structure, mechanisms for onboarding new participants

---

### What You're Doing BETTER:

**1. Radical Information Distribution**

The commons literature focuses heavily on **consolidation** (universities, libraries, centralized repositories). Commons.garden is doing the opposite - using dispersed FigJam, HackMD, Signal, GitLab.

**This is innovative** because it reflects p2p/SSB reality - but the literature warns that global digital commons need high degrees of **cooperation and coordination** even among dispersed individuals who never meet face-to-face.

**2. Focus on Facilitators (not just Experts)**

Phase 3 roadmap mentions "find facilitators, facilitate for facilitators, volunteer rotation." This is **more horizontal** than the academic models described in literature, which still gravitate around scholars and librarians.

---

### What You're Doing WORSE (or not yet doing):

**1. Missing Ostrom's Design Principles**

Elinor Ostrom identified principles for successful commons:
- ✅ Clearly defined boundaries
- ✅ Cost-benefit equivalence
- ✅ Locally adapted rules for collective governance
- ✅ **Monitoring**
- ✅ **Graduated sanctions**
- ✅ **Conflict resolution mechanisms**
- ✅ **Right of users to organize**
- ✅ **Nested structures**

**Commons.garden has:** Poorly defined boundaries (who is a gardener?), no formal monitoring, no sanctions, no formal conflict resolution.

**2. Fragmented Communication Across Multiple Platforms** 📌

The literature is explicit: **clear communication channels** are essential. You have:
- HackMD for docs
- FigJam for boards
- Signal for discussions
- GitLab for issues
- Now GitHub?

**Risk:** Transmission failure - when information doesn't flow between generations/members.

**3. Undefined Scale**

The commons literature shows **spatial scale** has changed dramatically - from local to global. Commons.garden needs to decide:
- Is it local (specific SSB community)?
- Is it global (any commons project)?
- How do nested structures work?

---

### Literature Recommendations for Commons.garden:

**From Ostrom's work:**

1. **Create democratic governance structure** with:
   - Clear jurisdiction and priorities
   - Defined role for participants
   - Negotiated rules
   - Reciprocity for sustainability
   - Formal communication channels

2. **Implement conflict resolution mechanisms**
   - Clear processes for disputes
   - Graduated sanctions (not immediate banning)
   - Right to appeal decisions

3. **Define boundaries:**
   - Who can be a gardener?
   - Who can create initiatives?
   - Which specs are accepted?

**From Knowledge Commons work:**

4. **Include non-experts** (you already do this!)
   - Adolescents, volunteers, non-devs
   - "Ordinary people should be knowledge creators"

5. **Create LOCAL knowledge**
   - Information useful for specific places/communities
   - Commons.garden could focus on "knowledge commons for SSB ecosystem"

6. **Reclaim control of intellectual assets**
   - Alternatives to corporate/academic model
   - Shared governance with rules defined by constituents

### Direct Summary:

| Aspect | Commons.garden | Commons Literature | Verdict |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Multi-stakeholder collaboration** | ✅ FigJam, Signal, show-and-tell | ✅ Established pattern | **Similar** |
| **Formal governance** | ❌ Non-existent | ✅ Critical for success | **Worse** |
| **Conflict mechanisms** | ❌ None documented | ✅ Essential (Ostrom) | **Worse** |
| **Radical distribution** | ✅ Multi-platform, p2p | ⚠️ Literature prefers consolidation | **Better** (but risky) |
| **Non-expert inclusion** | ✅ Volunteers, facilitators | ⚠️ Still focused on experts | **Better** |
| **Clear boundaries** | ❌ Fuzzy | ✅ Necessary | **Worse** |
| **Knowledge as commons** | ✅ Specs, docs, initiatives | ✅ Core concept | **Similar** |
| **Social capital** | ✅ SSB community | ✅ Necessary | **Similar** |

### Sources Referenced:

- "Understanding Knowledge as a Commons" - Multiple chapters on collective action, civic engagement, knowledge commons governance, scholarly communication
- "The Sustainable Economics of Elinor Ostrom" - Design principles for successful commons
- "Protecting the Commons" - Community-based participatory groups, spatial scales expansion

**Key Finding:** Commons.garden is innovating in distribution and inclusion but critically lacks the formal governance structures that research shows are essential for commons sustainability.

---

## Next Steps for v0.2.0:

Based on this research:

1. **Priority:** Define governance structure BEFORE consolidating information
2. **Consider:** Keep multi-platform BUT create clear "source of truth" hierarchy
3. **Design:** Conflict resolution mechanisms as part of consolidation
4. **Document:** Clear boundaries (who/what/when) in consolidated docs
