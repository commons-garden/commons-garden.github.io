### 📚 Literature Comparison - Intake Questions

**✅ Aligned with Commons Research:**

- **Stakeholder mapping** ("stakeholder = user, judge, decider") matches Ostrom's emphasis on clearly defined boundaries and participant roles
- **User stories & documentation** aligns with knowledge commons need for documented shared understanding
- **Success criteria & deliverables** reflects commons requirement for clear goals and outcomes

**⚠️ FigJam's Unique Innovations:**

- **"Gardener" role** - Commons.garden's term is more organic than literature's "monitors" or "facilitators"
- **Hashtag** - Modern digital organizing tool, no historical commons equivalent
- **"Flexible foundations"** - Novel question not addressed in commons literature

**💡 Literature Suggests Adding:**

- **Conflict resolution process** - Ostrom identifies as critical design principle, missing from intake
- **Monitoring mechanisms** - Who checks if initiative is progressing?
- **Graduated sanctions** - What happens if deliverables aren't met?
- **Exit strategy** - Can initiatives be deprecated? How?

- Project sponsorship
- Grants

### Other Ways to Help

*(to be defined)*

---

### 📚 Literature Comparison - Vision & Financing

**✅ Aligned with Commons Research:**

- **Permalinks/stable references** - Literature emphasizes long-term sustainability and persistent identifiers for knowledge commons
- **Multiple financing models** - Commons research shows successful commons use diverse revenue streams (not single source dependency)
- **Fiscal sponsor** - Common model for commons organizations (Open Collective, fiscal hosts)

**⚠️ FigJam Goes Further:**

- **"Preliminary face for Bassel conference"** - Tactical event-driven milestone, more specific than literature's abstract governance discussions
- **Policy on tool support** - Proactive boundary-setting uncommon in commons literature (usually reactive)

**💡 Literature Suggests:**

- **Financial transparency mechanisms** - Commons literature stresses this heavily, FigJam mentions it but doesn't detail process
- **Cost-benefit equivalence** (Ostrom principle) - Those who contribute most should benefit proportionally
- **Reserve funds/sustainability** - Literature warns against relying only on grants (too volatile)

**📖 From Previous Research:**

Commons scholars document that successful knowledge commons balance:
1. User contributions (donations, memberships)
2. Institutional support (grants, sponsors)
3. In-kind contributions (volunteer labor, "paid in meaning")

FigJam's "we pay people in meaning" is innovative but risky - literature shows purely volunteer commons often fail due to burnout.

---

## 🟣 Purple Notes - Research

### Finances & Compensation Models

**We pay people in meaning**

**We pay people with accreditation**

**Respect to their boundaries:**
- How much capacity
- Channels for communication

**We help people to pivot to work in what they care about**

### Gardener Expectations

- Sensitive - notice problems, name them

### Public Web Hosting Workflow

```mermaid

```

1. Loose spec
2. Broken implementation
3. Community pushback
4. Formalisation of spec
5. Clear shared spec
6. Build to the spec

### Skills/People Needed

- People who have done conflict resolution
- Interested in long term sustainability

---

### 📚 Literature Comparison - Compensation & Workflow

**✅ Aligned with Commons Research:**

- **"People who have done conflict resolution"** - Directly matches Ostrom's design principle #6 (conflict resolution mechanisms)
- **"Interested in long term sustainability"** - Central theme in all commons literature
- **Respect boundaries (capacity, communication)** - Aligns with commons emphasis on reciprocity and avoiding burnout

## 🔬 Second Research Pass (Jan 2026)

**Query:** "gardener facilitator stakeholder intake governance volunteer compensation"
**Results:** 8 chunks from 6 books (24 retrieved, reranked)

### 🆕 What's NEW This Time

**1. FOSS Volunteer Ecosystem Details** (Understanding Knowledge as a Commons, p.300)

- **3 types of motivations:**
  - **Technological:** Need software unavailable/too expensive, can't build alone
  - **Sociopolitical:** "Software should be free" philosophy (FSF), anti-monopoly stance
  - **Economic:** Building human capital (learning by doing), signaling expertise for jobs
- **~33% of FOSS developers are PAID by employers** to participate (Ghosh 2002)
- **"Passion" is critical driver** - projects must be interesting to attract/retain volunteers
- **Failure factors:** "inability to gain critical mass of eager volunteer programmers" + "lack of financing to pay for participants"
- **Credit is KEY norm:** Giving attribution to code authors enables reputation building

💡 **Parallel to commons.garden:** Mix of volunteer gardeners (passion-driven) + potential paid facilitators (sustainability-driven). Credit/attribution = essential for reputation economy.

---

**2. "Monitor the Monitor" Problem** (Understanding Institutional Diversity, p.251)

- **4 payment methods for forest guards:**
  1. Each household pays in kind (grains, services)
  2. Each household pays in cash
  3. Forest user organization pays from general funds
  4. Government distributes funds
- **"Farmers pay guards directly enables farmers to 'monitor' the monitor more effectively"**
- **Oath-taking rituals:** Guards taken to temple to "break a coconut" and vow impartiality before collecting Rs10/acre/month
- **Proportionality principle:** Benefits received must roughly match costs paid

💡 **Parallel to commons.garden:** If we pay facilitators, who monitors THEM? Direct payment by gardeners creates accountability loop. Ritual onboarding (oath equivalents) build commitment.

---

**3. Input Bias vs Outcome Focus** (The Samaritan's Dilemma, p.71)

- **Career concerns model (Holmstrom 1982):** Agents motivated by "demonstrating abilities" not immediate monetary rewards
- **Aid agencies:** Staff are salaried, not performance-linked → strategic selection of tasks
- **Input bias:** Focus on easily monitored activities (reports, meetings, deliverables)
- **Outcome neglect:** Sustainability outcomes are "far more difficult to monitor" → deprioritized

💡 **Parallel to commons.garden:** If we pay facilitators salary (vs outcome-based), they'll optimize for visible work (meeting notes, process docs) over hard-to-measure outcomes (trust building, conflict resolution quality, long-term community health).

---

**4. Consultant-Donor "In Bed" Problem** (The Samaritan's Dilemma, p.204)

- **Sida/Orissa forestry case:** "Consultants were in bed with Sida" - shared office, called "Sida Forestry Coordination Project"
- **Zero beneficiary ownership:** "Local communities had NO input into design, even though project seeks to invoke their participation"
- **Forest Department resistance:** De facto control already passed to communities → reforms would reduce their power further
- **NGO role:** Vocal critics highlighting indigenous institutions, lobbying for community ownership

💡 **Parallel to commons.garden:** Risk if external funders (grants, sponsors) hire facilitators who are loyal to FUNDER not GARDENERS. Need beneficiary ownership from design phase, not just execution.

---

**5. NGO Conflicts: "Deep Green" vs Community-Oriented** (The Commons in the New Millennium, p.332)

- **Thailand Community Forestry Bill:** Two opposing NGO camps
  - **Community-oriented NGOs:** Northern Development Foundation, promoting People's Draft, advocating ethnic minorities in protected areas
  - **"Deep green" NGOs:** Environmental groups wanting to prohibit community forests in protected areas
- **Trigger events:** Formation of watershed groups driven by (a) water shortage, (b) protecting forests against private investors/state claims
- **Broader movement:** Civil rights, minority rights, anti-state bureaucracy, decentralization, anti-commercialization

💡 **Parallel to commons.garden:** If we engage external advocacy orgs, expect conflicts between "purity" groups (tech perfection, strict decentralization) vs "pragmatist" groups (community needs first). Water scarcity = our equivalent crisis that forces organization.

---

**6. Formal-Informal Substitution** (Linking the Formal and Informal Economy, p.231)

- **Voluntary contributions to local public goods:** Time, money, in-kind services to community associations
- **Government intervention paradox:** External funding can SUBSTITUTE (crowd out) or COMPLEMENT voluntary contributions
- **Challenge:** "If formal sector merely substitutes for informal, net benefits may be much smaller than when activities are complementary"
- **Optimal design:** Harness 'bonding' social capital while gaining access to 'bridging' capital

💡 **Parallel to commons.garden:** If we get grant funding, does it kill volunteer energy ("why should I contribute if they have money?") or amplify it (professional facilitators enable more volunteer participation)? Need complementary design.

---

**7. Microfinance Meetings as Governance Venue** (The Commons in the New Millennium, p.304)

- **Microcredit groups (Grameen Bank model):** Regular meetings create communication channels
- **Repurposing:** Meetings designed for loan accountability ALSO used to "monitor and amend day-to-day operational rules governing CPR use"
- **Women as primary CPR users:** If women manage forests/water, microfinance provides conduit for changing operational rules among themselves
- **"Bridging capital":** MFOs provide external assistance to break perverse logic when groups are blocked by powerful individuals

💡 **Parallel to commons.garden:** Our "show and tell" meetings (designed for demo/learning) could ALSO become governance venue. Women/marginalized gardeners might need separate spaces to develop rules before engaging broader community.

---

**8. User Attributes for Success** (People and Forests, p.258)

**From Ostrom's framework - 6 critical user attributes:**

- **A1. Salience:** Users depend on resource for major livelihood portion
- **A2. Common understanding:** Shared mental model of resource + how actions affect each other
- **A3. Low discount rate:** Value future benefits sufficiently
- **A4. Trust & reciprocity:** Users trust each other to keep promises
- **A5. Autonomy:** Users can determine rules without external authorities countermanding
- **A6. Prior organizational experience:** Learned skills through other local associations

💡 **Parallel to commons.garden:** Our intake questions map to these! "Why join?" (A1 salience), "What can you offer/need?" (A2 understanding), "Long term interest?" (A3 discount rate), "Done this before?" (A6 experience). Missing: explicit trust/autonomy questions.

**⚠️ FigJam's Innovations:**

- **"We pay people in meaning"** - Novel framing! Literature discusses "intrinsic motivation" but rarely as explicit compensation model
- **"We pay people with accreditation"** - Recognition/reputation as currency - seen in open-source commons but undertheorized in academic literature
- **"Help people pivot to work they care about"** - Not found in commons literature; more aligned with social entrepreneurship/career coaching

**💡 Literature Warns:**

- **Purely non-monetary compensation is risky** - Research on volunteer commons shows high failure rates due to:
  - Burnout (no boundaries on unpaid labor)
  - "Founder's trap" (few people do most work)
  - Class bias (only those with financial security can participate)

**📖 Public Web Hosting Workflow Analysis:**

```
FigJam: Loose spec → Broken impl → Pushback → Formalization → Clear spec → Build
Literature: Called "adaptive governance" or "iterative refinement"
```

**✅ This matches commons research:**
- Ostrom's "learning by doing"
- "Rules-in-use" vs "rules-in-form"
- Community-driven norm evolution

**BUT literature adds:**
- **Monitoring at each step** (who validates the spec formalization?)
- **Graduated sanctions** (what if step 6 "build to spec" fails?)
- **Nested structures** (how does this workflow connect to larger governance?)

## � BREAKTHROUGH: Reputation Economy Over Monetary Compensation

**Anarchist Insight (Jan 2026):** "Não levo fé em pagamentos. Gardener precisa no mínimo um título tipo 'Classe de 2026'. É networking."

### 💎 Solution: Credentials + Resume Commons

**Instead of money, provide:**

1. **Formal Titles/Credentials:**
   - "Class of 2026 Gardener"
   - "Certified Commons Facilitator"
   - "Conflict Resolution Specialist (commons.garden)"
   - "SSB Protocol Contributor (2025-2026)"

2. **Resume Commons:**
   - Public portfolio: "Gardener X helped organizations Y, Z with initiatives A, B"
   - Verifiable contributions to commons
   - Peer endorsements
   - Project artifacts (specs, resolved conflicts, facilitated decisions)

3. **Network Effects:**
   - Reputation travels across projects
   - Future employment opportunities from portfolio visibility
   - "Signaling expertise" without traditional employer reference

### ✅ How This SOLVES All 8 Literature Problems

| Problem | Traditional Money Solution | Reputation Economy Solution |
|---------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **1. Monitor the monitor** | Who watches paid facilitators? | Reputation is SELF-POLICED - bad work = public portfolio damage |
| **2. Input bias** | Salary → focus on visible tasks (reports) | Reputation depends on REAL OUTCOMES (did conflict get resolved?) |
| **3. Consultant loyalty** | Paid by donor → loyal to donor | Reputation tied to PUBLIC COMMONS → loyal to community |
| **4. Formal substitutes informal** | Money crowds out volunteers | Credentials COMPLEMENT passion ("I volunteer AND get recognized") |
| **5. Critical mass failure** | Can't afford to pay everyone | Titles/portfolio = free, scales to entire community |
| **6. "Deep green" vs pragmatist** | Money = commercialization critique | Commons credentials = non-commercial, ideologically pure |
| **7. Beneficiary ownership** | External funders control design | Portfolio requires BENEFICIARY TESTIMONIALS = power shift |
| **8. Prior experience (A6)** | Need CV from traditional institutions | Resume commons = portable, verifiable commons experience |

### 🎓 Credential Tiers (Draft)

**Tier 1: Contributor**
- Participated in ≥3 initiatives
- Portfolio: "Contributed to X, Y, Z"

**Tier 2: Gardener (Class of 20XX)**
- Facilitated ≥1 initiative from intake to completion
- ≥2 peer endorsements
- Portfolio: "Led initiative X, supported by gardeners A, B"

**Tier 3: Conflict Resolution Specialist**
- Resolved ≥2 documented conflicts
- Training in commons governance
- Portfolio: "Mediated conflicts in contexts X, Y"

**Tier 4: Protocol Contributor**
- Contributed to ≥1 SSB spec/standard
- Code/documentation merged
- Portfolio: "Co-authored SSB Collections v2.0"

### 📋 Resume Commons Structure

```yaml
gardener:
  name: "mixmix"
  class: "2025"
  credentials:
    - "Certified Commons Facilitator"
    - "SSB Protocol Contributor"
  portfolio:
    - initiative: "SSB Collections Spec"
      role: "Lead Author"
      outcome: "Merged into Scuttlebutt protocol"
      endorsements: ["cblgh", "cel", "staltz"]
    - initiative: "Ahau Calendar Integration"
      role: "Facilitator"
      organizations_helped: ["Ahau", "Manyverse"]
      outcome: "Shared calendar component adopted by 2 apps"
      endorsements: ["ben_tairea", "powersource"]
  skills_offered: ["JavaScript", "Conflict Resolution", "Technical Writing"]
  available_for: ["Protocol Design", "Community Facilitation"]
```

### 🌐 Public Visibility = Accountability

- **Portfolio is PUBLIC** → Bad facilitation = visible failure
- **Endorsements are PEER-TO-PEER** → Can't game the system without community consent
- **Organizations helped = references** → Future employers can contact them
- **Credentials are VERIFIABLE** → Link to actual commits, merged specs, resolved issues

### 💰 But What About Sustainability?

**Not zero money, but DIFFERENT money:**

- Gardeners work volunteer (for credentials/portfolio)
- Organizations that BENEFIT pay commons.garden (not individual gardeners)
- Commons.garden uses funds for:
  - Infrastructure (hosting, domains)
  - Tools (software, platforms)
  - Events (gatherings, conferences)
  - Scholarships (enable participation for those who can't afford volunteer time)

**Result:** Money flows to COMMONS (infrastructure), reputation flows to GARDENERS (individuals)

This is the FOSS model: Developers volunteer for reputation, companies pay Linux Foundation for infrastructure.

- Everything goes to the commons

**Core Functions:**
- Conflict resolution
- Push for standards (manage any features that are critical to community)

### Criteria for Picking Up Initiatives

- Network effect?
- New vistas?
- Aligning parallel work, detecting overlaps

---

**Each discipline needs its own:**
- **Advocacy** - help others understand how to make the most of you
- **Onboarding**

### Pay Structure for Gardeners

Considerations:
- Discipline
- Demographics

---

## 💰 Finances (Expanded)

### Revenue Models to Explore

- Donation?
- Membership?

---

### 📚 Literature Comparison - Features, Vision & Volunteers

**💡 Possible Features:**

- **Edit and version control** - ✅ Standard in knowledge commons (Git, wikis)
- **Language (i18n)** - ✅ Commons literature emphasizes inclusivity across linguistic boundaries

---

**🎯 What We Want to Be:**

**"How to keep it anarchic"**

**⚠️ Tension Identified by Literature:**

FigJam wants: "Anarchic" structure
Literature shows: Successful commons need **clear governance** (but can be decentralized/polycentric)

**Resolution from Ostrom:**
- **Polycentric governance** ≠ anarchic
- Multiple decision-making centers
- Clear rules at each level
- "We're accredited too" → mutual accountability (✅ aligns with commons reciprocity)

**"Everything goes to the commons"**

✅ Strong alignment with open knowledge commons principles (copyleft, public domain, CC licenses)

**"Push for standards"**

✅ Matches knowledge commons literature on:
- Interoperability
- Preventing fragmentation
- But: Who decides critical features? Literature says democratic processes needed

**Criteria for picking up initiatives:**

- Network effect? ✅ Commons literature on "network externalities"
- New vistas? ⚠️ Not in literature (innovation vs stability trade-off)
- Aligning parallel work? ✅ Core commons function (avoiding duplication)

---

**👥 Volunteer Management:**

**"We have light volunteering for code... but not for UX/UI"**

**📖 Literature Insight:**

This is called **"contribution asymmetry"** in commons research. It occurs when:
- Technical contributions are easier to integrate (code = modular)
- Design/UX requires more coordination (holistic, opinionated)
- Solution from literature: **Domain-specific governance** (exactly what FigJam proposes!)

**"Each discipline needs its own: advocacy, onboarding"**

✅ Perfect match with commons research on:
- **Nested structures** (Ostrom principle #8)
- **Specialized working groups** (seen in Wikipedia, open-source projects)
- **Domain experts as facilitators**

**Volunteer Maestro (HackMD)**

✅ Commons literature calls this **"coordinator role"** or **"meta-governance"**
- Essential for preventing fragmentation
- Risky: Single point of failure if maestro burns out
- Literature recommends: **Rotating facilitation** (FigJam already mentions this!)

**"Gardeners onboard institutions and volunteers"**

✅ Matches commons research on **"boundary spanners"**:
- Bridge between community and external organizations
- Translate between cultures (institutions ↔ volunteers)
- Critical for commons that interface with formal organizations

**Pay gardeners: discipline, demographics**

**💡 Literature Recommends:**

- **Transparency in compensation** (FigJam already asks this!)
- **Avoid class/race bias** - Demographics consideration is wise
- **Hybrid model:** Some paid coordinators + volunteer contributors (most stable according to research)

---

## Usage Notes

This intake questionnaire appears to be the standard process for evaluating and onboarding new initiatives. It ensures:

1. **Clear identity** (name, hashtag, relevance)
2. **Documentation exists** (history, user stories)
3. **Ownership assigned** (gardener role)
4. **Success defined** (done criteria, phases, deliverables)
5. **Stakeholders mapped** (who's affected, who decides, skillsets needed)
6. **Resources identified** (financial, communication channels)
7. **Context understood** (relation to other initiatives, future opportunities)

---

## 📊 FigJam vs Commons Literature - Summary Comparison

| FigJam Concept | Commons Literature Equivalent | Verdict |
|----------------|------------------------------|---------|
| **Intake Questions** | Boundary definition, stakeholder analysis | ✅ Well-aligned |
| **Gardener role** | Monitor/facilitator/boundary spanner | ⚠️ FigJam's term is more organic |
| **Hashtag** | N/A (modern digital tool) | 💡 Novel innovation |
| **Success criteria** | Clear goals/outcomes requirement | ✅ Well-aligned |
| **Flexible foundations** | N/A | 💡 Novel question |
| **"Pay in meaning"** | Intrinsic motivation | ⚠️ Risky without hybrid model |
| **"Pay in accreditation"** | Reputation systems | ⚠️ Under-theorized in literature |
| **Respect boundaries** | Reciprocity, avoid burnout | ✅ Well-aligned |
| **Public web hosting workflow** | Adaptive governance, rules-in-use | ✅ Matches iterative refinement |
| **"Keep it anarchic"** | Polycentric governance | ⚠️ Tension: commons need clear rules |
| **"Everything to commons"** | Open knowledge commons | ✅ Strong alignment |
| **Push for standards** | Interoperability, prevent fragmentation | ✅ Well-aligned |
| **Network effect criteria** | Network externalities | ✅ Well-aligned |
| **Aligning parallel work** | Avoid duplication | ✅ Core commons function |
| **Volunteer maestro** | Coordinator/meta-governance | ✅ Well-aligned (but risky if single person) |
| **Discipline-specific advocacy** | Domain governance, nested structures | ✅ Perfect match with Ostrom principle #8 |
| **Multiple financing models** | Diverse revenue streams | ✅ Well-aligned |
| **Transparency in compensation** | Financial transparency principle | ✅ Critical (literature emphasizes heavily) |

### Key Findings:

**✅ FigJam Strengths vs Literature:**
- Strong intuitive grasp of commons principles (even without citing Ostrom)
- Innovative framing ("gardener", "paid in meaning", hashtags)
- Nested/domain-specific governance proposal is textbook Ostrom

**⚠️ Gaps Identified by Literature:**
- Missing: Formal conflict resolution mechanisms
- Missing: Monitoring at each workflow step
- Missing: Graduated sanctions for non-compliance
- Missing: Exit strategies for deprecated initiatives
- Risk: Pure non-monetary compensation can lead to burnout/class bias

**💡 Novel Innovations Not in Literature:**
- "Flexible foundations" as selection criterion
- Hashtag-based organizing
- "Help people pivot to work they care about" (career-oriented)
- Gardener as unified role (monitor + facilitator + boundary spanner)

**Recommendation:** FigJam should add formal governance structures from Ostrom while keeping its innovative organic terminology and compensation models (but with hybrid monetary support to avoid burnout).

## 📖 Direct Literature Quotes Relevant to FigJam

### On Collective Action & Community

> "The process of creating public knowledge as an additional good, because such work builds social capital, strengthens communities, and gives people skills that they need for effective citizenship."
> — Peter Levine, "Understanding Knowledge as a Commons"

**FigJam parallel:** "We help people pivot to work in what they care about" - same principle of capacity-building through participation.

---

### On Governance Requirements

> "Self-governance requires collective action combined with knowledge and will on the one hand, and supporting and consistent institutional arrangements on the other hand."
> — Hess & Ostrom, "Understanding Knowledge as a Commons"

**FigJam gap:** Strong on "knowledge and will" (intake questions, gardeners), weak on "institutional arrangements" (formal conflict resolution, sanctions).

---

### On Boundaries & Rules

> "Following the framework outlined by Ostrom and Hess, self-governance of these newly emerging commons will require definition of boundaries (which tend to be fuzzy), design and enforcement of rules, extension of reciprocity, building of trust and social capital, and delineation of communication channels."
> — Nancy Kranich, "Understanding Knowledge as a Commons"

**FigJam alignment:**
- ✅ Boundaries: "Who should be on the table?"
- ✅ Reciprocity: "Respect to their boundaries"
- ✅ Communication: "Where we have internal communication?"
- ❌ Missing: Enforcement mechanisms

---

### On Community-Based Participation

> "Community-based participatory groups can address some problems in the decision process. Such groups must be inclusive and have a community-wide reputation for honesty. They can help disparate groups to find and clarify shared interests that all participants agree on."
> — "Protecting the Commons"

**FigJam implementation:** Show-and-tell, Signal groups, FigJam collaborative boards - exactly this model!

---

### On Compensation & Sustainability

> "Social capital refers to the aggregate value of social networks (i.e., who people know), and the inclinations that arise from these networks for people to do things for each other (i.e., the norms of reciprocity)."
> — "Understanding Knowledge as a Commons"

**FigJam innovation:** "We pay people in meaning" + "we pay people with accreditation" = building social capital as compensation. Novel but risky without hybrid model.

---

### On Nested Structures

> "Each discipline needs its own: advocacy - help others understand how to make the most of you, onboarding"

**Literature confirmation:** Ostrom's Design Principle #8: "Appropriation, provision, monitoring, enforcement, conflict resolution, and governance activities are organized in multiple layers of nested enterprises."

FigJam's domain-specific onboarding = textbook nested governance! ✅

---

### On Monitoring & Accountability

> "Monitoring" and "Graduated sanctions" are critical design principles for successful commons.
> — Ostrom's principles, summarized in "The Sustainable Economics of Elinor Ostrom"

**FigJam gap:** Public web hosting workflow has iteration but no formal monitoring role at each step. Who validates that "formalization of spec" actually happened correctly?

---

## 🎯 Final Synthesis

FigJam demonstrates **intuitive understanding** of commons principles without directly citing academic literature. The intake questions, gardener role, and nested governance proposals align remarkably well with decades of commons research.

**Critical additions needed** (per literature):
1. Formal conflict resolution mechanisms
2. Monitoring roles at each workflow step
3. Graduated accountability (not just binary success/failure)
4. Hybrid compensation (meaning + money) to avoid burnout/class bias

**Unique FigJam contributions** to commons theory:
- "Gardener" as unified coordinator role
- "Paid in meaning/accreditation" explicit framing
- Hashtag-based organizing for digital commons
- Career-pivot support as commons function
