Reframing SSB tags as collections

>{.aaa} Resurfacing posts outside chronological order, reducing Bias of Now

> Think "mix's book of soup recipes" "nonlinear book of illustration tips" or "rabble book of East Asia travel spots"

> Some users don't write much, but curate existing content. Collections give them a way to shine.

> Tags were poorly named. Under the hood they behave like a collection, but they don't have order. 

> Book collections can have internal chronological order. Or author can reorder if they want. It's on them.

> Difference from SSB tags:
	- how is presented
	- books are part of profile (for discoverability)
	- books are authoral, and people can follow books for changes

> SSB is long form, slow reading, we should honor old posts.

> Posts should have CC licensing, so Books can have licensing too.
