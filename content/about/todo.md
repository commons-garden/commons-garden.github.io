## Admin

## subpages

- [ ] page template checkjs if slug has a folder and:
	- lists all public pages in alphabetical order, into a table of content
	- folder pages point to original page
- [ ] subgroups should not be listed on list.html (or should? we need at least a new template)

## Workflows

Discuss how we do things

- [ ] redirect template: `p2p-delete` becomes `p2p_delete`
- [ ] redirect policy

## Internal documentation

How we write and update documentation for our facilitators?

- [ ] maybe as we pass on knowledge, we write our manuals
- [ ] checklists. CHECKLISTS!
- [ ] adding categories tutorial: css, nav, json, etc
- [ ] template inside tutorial (loop from yml file)

## Design

- [ ] design favicons
- [ ] design stickers
- [ ] bg animation (vector, subtle)

## Glossary

- [ ] discuss what we want for glossary
- [ ] glossary vs context
- [ ] term + synonyms + deprecated (use this one instead and why)
- [ ] how to ensure glossary is being read, consulted?
- [ ] repackaging content

## Tech Debt

- [ ] categories should point to .json, not category-description
- [ ] why title? It should point to filename
- [ ] why category? It should point to folder
- [ ] reset select
