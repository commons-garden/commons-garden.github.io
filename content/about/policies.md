## 1. Guarding and enhancing the commons

(what projects have to have for us to sponsor it? why? be explicit)

- usability
- security
- aligning parallel work
	- connections
- conflict resolution
- coalescing (standards, patterns)
- code of conduct
- technical standards

## 2. Low-stress emotional labor

Maintenance never ends, so organization ideas win speed

## 3. From nouns to verbs

An effort *towards*, not a state of perfection

## 4. We serve the community

- start with community we know (scuttlebutt)
- no have time to do specs? we can help.
- we can resource that for you!
- you can focus on great experiences instead
- we get it off your plate
- conflict resolution
- reaching agreements
- accelerator
