## Assumptions to validate

> Simulations as a laboratory, providing data scientists with tools prove shit mathematically

> A tool to validate arguments

> It also detects attacks way earlier. By reverse engineering strategies and proposing patches. Because we will be attacked. Of course

> Simulations can detect attacks and propose vaccinations

> How can SSB have a good relationship with data scientists, so researchers can use it for their papers?

> Manuel de landa idea: A layer of simulation tools between hunch and testing, for science.

> A playground

> Not for proving something but creating a path for people to simulate and bring results.

> How to attract data scientists that want to show their chops, but corporate social media keep it lock and key?

> Model communities to test: No problem with surveillance coz it tests there. We can have packs, different topologies.
