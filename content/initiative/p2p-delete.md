> we had a very fruitful session at dweb camp 2023. We're still consolidating our notes, the raw notes can be found [here](https://hackmd.io/@mixmix/BJ4lBxcFh)

Sometimes we want to make a piece of data irretrievable.
Given a distributed system subject to intermittent connectivity, partitions, and variable trust,
how do we effectively syndicate deletions among peers?
What does it mean for a distributed delete to be 'good enough'?

Data in systems like Hypercore and SSB is often "signed" by an author, which makes it particularly dangerous.
When the hash of the data is also signed,
the data's metadata can be used in a "Confirmation Of A File Attack" to prove that the author once possessed the data.
